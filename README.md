# Viral Entry Mechanisms: Multilingual Research Summary Hub\n\n## Abstract\nThis repository hosts the research paper "Molecular Mechanisms of Viral Entry into Host Cells: A Structural and Functional Analysis" and its translations. The study investigates key viral entry pathways, focusing on receptor-binding domains, membrane fusion proteins, and endocytic mechanisms employed by enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Using cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal novel conformational changes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and identify potential targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics.\n\n## Project Overview\nThis hub serves as a collaborative platform for translating research summaries into multiple languages, enhancing global accessibility of virology findings.\n\n## Translations\n- [Spanish translation](manuscripts/spanish-summary.md) (completed)\n- German translation (in progress)\n- Mandarin translation (in progress)\n\n## License\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0.
